# Export Self Assessment

## Problem to be solved
- The team has been brought together to evaluate and pilot the use of an Export Self Assessment diagnostic tool
- This will be evaluated with 3 audiences
    - Pilot Project companies
    - Representatives from relevant Scottish organisations
    - A pool of Scottish Companies that have been identified as Pre or Early stage exporters
 
### Early considerations

- Identify company stage
- Identify level of current engagement with public sector (i.e. Are they already talking to a trade advisor somehere...)
- Identify what is available at that company stage
- Is there a gap that needs to be filled for any of these companies
- Identify Support or Signpost inflection points
