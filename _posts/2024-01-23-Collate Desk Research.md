# Desk Research  
Discovered relevant research from projects: 
- 2015: Export Health assesment tool
    - This is a very similar project but with a slightly different audience and question set
- 2020: Export Research
    - Export Needs and Service mapppings were developed that are "in part" relevant o this project 
- 2021: Innovation Toolkit  
    - Investigated and Built a Diagnostic tool that has many similarities to this projects proposed solution
