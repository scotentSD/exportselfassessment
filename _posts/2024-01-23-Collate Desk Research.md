# Desk Research  
Discovered relevant research from projects: 

**2015: Export Health assesment tool**
- This is a very similar "diagnostic tool" project, but with a slightly different audience and question set2

**2020: Export Research**
- Export Needs and Service mapppings were developed that are "in part" relevant to this project 

**2021: Innovation Toolkit**
- Investigated and built a Diagnostic tool that has many similarities to this projects proposed solution
